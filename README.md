How to build and test Better Explorer
======================================
**You can also download a Milestone build to test new features.**

Important: This process includes the installation of either Visual C# Express 2010 or SharpDevelop. Visual C# Express 2010 takes longer to install, but is 100% guaranteed to work with BetterExplorer.

Anyway, here's how it's done (in just 3 steps!):

1. **Download the builder** Download and install Visual C# Express 2010 or SharpDevelop. (They can be found with a quick search online.)
THe developers user Visual C# Express 2010 but the instructions are the same if you use SharpDevelop.

2. **Get the source code**
On the top of this page, click on the "ZIP" button to download the latest build in a zip file. Unzip the file into a new, empty folder.

3. **Make the program**
Now that you downloaded and unzipped the source code, open the folder you created, and you should see five folders and three files inside it. Double-click on BExplorer.sln and it will open up in Visual C# Express or SharpDevelop. (In Visual C# Express, a few dialogs will appear. Just click "OK". They are not important.) Then, before doing anything else, open the Build menu and select "Build Solution". This will make the program, and if any errors occur, check back on the Source Code page within 10 minutes to see if we posted any fixes.

To access the program, open the BExplorer folder, and then open the BetterExplorer folder. A folder called "bin" should have been created in there. Open that up and then open the "Debug" folder, and ta-da! There it is!
